Wishes:
- rsi instructions <---- please contact us if you can do this....
- [BS] strict-o-meter
- [BS] A second timer implementation which ignores idle detection
- Save statistics (sqlite?)
- Visualize stats with libraries behind mrtg or ganglia

Bugs:
- image extension are hardcoded
- only reset timers after closing configure dialog if the timer settings were changed

Gnome specific bugs:
- It is started at login, regardless of the setting.
  Gnome does not have a setting where you can set a condition to start / not
  start, nor can you disable the startup for Gnome when the desktop is in the
  $prefix/autostart. So: known bug - unresolvable untill a fd.o spec is
  there and implemented
