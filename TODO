Whishes:
- blank the other screens in a multihead / xinerama setup
- progress bar instead of counter during the break
- rsi instructions
- when no image path has yet been entered, default to a reasonable KDE path
- when no image path is entered, do not display a gray widget, but one with a button "set images path"

bugs (this is where you can help ;-)):
- image extension are hardcoded
- Adriaan reported a case were the countdown was painted over the previous time, making a mess.
