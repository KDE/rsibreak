Whishes (in order of implementation)
- take idle time into account before bothering the user.
- progress bar/animated icon to indicate next break
- progress bar instead of counter during the break
- rsi instructions

bugs (this is where you can help ;-)):

- image extension are hardcoded
- howto add the 'esc'-button to the shortcut configuration
