Whishes:
- rsi instructions
- when no image path has yet been entered, default to a reasonable KDE path
- when no image path is entered, do not display a gray widget, but one with a button "set images path"
- [BS] Stats
- [BS] strict-o-meter

Bugs: 
- image extension are hardcoded

Gnome specific bugs:
- It is started at login, regardless of the setting.
  Gnome does not have a setting where you can set a condition to start / not 
  start, nor can you disable the startup for GNome when the desktop is in the 
  $prefix/autostart. So: known bug - unresolvable untill a fd.o spec is 
  there and implemented
