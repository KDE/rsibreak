Port remarks:
- started, not finished, does not compile.
- D-Bus notes:
  * Exported functions must be under public Q_SLOTS: in src/rsiwidget.h
    i've added slotShowWhereIAm as an example.

    rsiwidget.h:

    /* Available through D-Bus */
    public Q_SLOTS:
        void slotShowWhereIAm();

    After adding new functions you must regenerate org.rsibreak.rsiwidget.xml
    to include the new functions.
    It's done like this:
    qdbuscpp2xml -M -s rsiwidget.h -o org.rsibreak.rsiwidget.xml

Wishes:
- rsi instructions <---- please contact us if you can do this....
- [BS] strict-o-meter
- Save statistics (sqlite?)
- Visualize stats with libraries behind mrtg or ganglia

To be fixed for next release:
- [BS] fix buttons accel on breaks. reported by tsdgeos
- [TA/BS] sometimes the amount of skipped/sat down breaks don't match its total. reported by toma
- Breaks can't be skipped when a full screen OpenGL game is running (keys and QPushButtons don't seem to work). reported by stanley^

To be fixed for/with KDE4:
- [TA] fix height of config screen, seems the options don't fit. Reported by Diego Iastrubni.
  Even when a setMinimumHeight is set, this seems to be ignored by KDialogBase.
- [TA] hook into KNotificationRestrictions - so you will not be bothered during presentations
  or games when they hook into that system as well. Reported by Achim.

Bugs:
- image extension are hardcoded
- only reset timers after closing configure dialog if the timer settings were changed

Gnome specific bugs:
- It is started at login, regardless of the setting.
  Gnome does not have a setting where you can set a condition to start / not
  start, nor can you disable the startup for Gnome when the desktop is in the
  $prefix/autostart. So: known bug - unresolvable untill a fd.o spec is
  there and implemented
