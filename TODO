Port TODO's:
- test on xinerama
- auto startup, find out if this still works the same.
- slideshow, the box does not seem to maintain focus, so esc does not work.

Remarks:
- D-Bus notes:
  * Exported functions must be under public Q_SLOTS: in src/rsiwidget.h
    i've added slotShowWhereIAm as an example.

    rsiwidget.h:

    /* Available through D-Bus */
    public Q_SLOTS:
        void slotShowWhereIAm();

    After adding new functions you must regenerate org.rsibreak.rsiwidget.xml
    to include the new functions.
    It's done like this:
    qdbuscpp2xml -M -s rsiwidget.h -o org.rsibreak.rsiwidget.xml

- Save statistics (sqlite?)
- Visualize stats with libraries behind mrtg or ganglia

Bugs:
- [TA] hook into KNotificationRestrictions - so you will not be bothered during presentations
  or games when they hook into that system as well. Reported by Achim.
  - as far as i can see there is only a client side - you can say that you are starting a presentation
    and that there should be no screensaver, but not the other way round, query if there is a presentation
    going on so you should not interfere with a popup at this moment.
- image extension are hardcoded
- only reset timers after closing configure dialog if the timer settings were changed
- [TA/BS] sometimes the amount of skipped/sat down breaks don't match its total. reported by toma
- screenshot is sometimes taken without a visible icon in the tray.
  - TA can't find a way to prevent that.

Gnome specific bugs:
- It is started at login, regardless of the setting.
  Gnome does not have a setting where you can set a condition to start / not
  start, nor can you disable the startup for Gnome when the desktop is in the
  $prefix/autostart. So: known bug - unresolvable untill a fd.o spec is
  there and implemented
