Port TODO's:
- test on xinerama

Remarks:
- D-Bus notes:
  * Exported functions must be under public Q_SLOTS: in src/rsiwidget.h
    i've added slotShowWhereIAm as an example.

    rsiwidget.h:

    /* Available through D-Bus */
    public Q_SLOTS:
        void slotShowWhereIAm();

    After adding new functions you must regenerate org.rsibreak.rsiwidget.xml
    to include the new functions.
    It's done like this:
    qdbuscpp2xml -M -s rsiwidget.h -o org.rsibreak.rsiwidget.xml

Bugs:
- image extension are hardcoded

Gnome specific bugs:
- It is started at login, regardless of the setting.
  Gnome does not have a setting where you can set a condition to start / not
  start, nor can you disable the startup for Gnome when the desktop is in the
  $prefix/autostart. So: known bug - unresolvable untill a fd.o spec is
  there and implemented
