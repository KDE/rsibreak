Whishes:
- rsi instructions
- when no image path has yet been entered, default to a reasonable KDE path
- when no image path is entered, do not display a gray widget, but one with a button "set images path"
- [TA] when a break is skipped due to idleness, show a popup that the break is skipped and remove that popup when idle=0.
- [TA||BS] Stats
- [BS] strict-o-meter

Bugs: 
- image extension are hardcoded
- spotted a 'minutes' and 'seconds' untranslated in tooltip while using the official 0.5 .deb (gnome only?)
- the clock in tray appears after the messagebox which states the clock is visible in tray (gnome only?)

Gnome specific bugs:
- Two Quit's in context menu
- It is started at login, regardless of the setting
