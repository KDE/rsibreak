Whishes (in order of implementation)
- put an icon in the rmb popup
- take idle time into account before bothering the user.
- progress bar/animated icon to indicate next break
- progress bar instead of counter during the break
- rsi instructions
- when no image path has yet been entered, default to a reasonable KDE path
- when no image path is entered, do not display a gray widget, but one with a button "set images path"

bugs (this is where you can help ;-)):
- image extension are hardcoded
- howto add the 'esc'-button to the shortcut configuration
