- [BS] strict-o-meter
- [BS] A second timer implementation which ignores idle detection
- Save statistics

Bugs:
- image extension are hardcoded
- in some cases, the tooltip does not appear
  ( note: seems only to happen after waiting for a big break in a relax popup ) (fixed?)
- when you're idle for the length of a big break, without any break active, it is not detected
- only reset timers after closing configure dialog if the timer settings were changed

Gnome specific bugs:
- It is started at login, regardless of the setting.
  Gnome does not have a setting where you can set a condition to start / not
  start, nor can you disable the startup for GNome when the desktop is in the
  $prefix/autostart. So: known bug - unresolvable untill a fd.o spec is
  there and implemented
