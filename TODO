Bugs:

Gnome specific bugs:
- It is started at login, regardless of the setting.
  Gnome does not have a setting where you can set a condition to start / not
  start, nor can you disable the startup for Gnome when the desktop is in the
  $prefix/autostart. So: known bug - unresolvable untill a fd.o spec is
  there and implemented
