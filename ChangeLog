	* trunk/playground/utils/rsibreak/src/rsiwidget.cpp,

	  trunk/playground/utils/rsibreak/src/rsitimer.cpp: - Change
	  solution. Do not always set the suspended state to false, but
	  keep the state while you are in the config. That means two
	  seperate slots to suspend. - Also, gives the possibility to set
	  the targettime to the current time, so the tooltip will show that
	  rsibreak is suspended instead of counting to 0 and then show that
	  message. - Also, prevent that the avarage calculation continious
	  in suspended state, because that will change the tray icon ;-)

2005-12-10 22:19 +0000 [r487524]  Tom Albers tomalbers@kde.nl

	* trunk/playground/utils/rsibreak/src/rsitimer.cpp: Bug fix: after
	  entering the config (m_suspended gets set to true) and leaving,
	  m_suspended did not got set to false. Also an extra safeguard to
	  bail out of maximize when suspended is true.

2005-10-21 14:50 +0000 [r472663]  Tom Albers tomalbers@kde.nl

	* trunk/playground/utils/rsibreak/src/rsiwidget.cpp: Since some of
	  the intelligence is also handled elsewhere, I can remove some of
	  the code, without functionality loss, but maybe with some
	  regressions ;-) Also fixed a whatsthis error, showing random

	* trunk/playground/utils/rsibreak/src/rsiwidget.cpp,
	  trunk/playground/utils/rsibreak/src/rsiwidget.h: Again changes in
	  the logic to have a break: - when it is time to have a break, and
	  the user is busy, wait for 5 seconds inactivity within a maximum
	  of 30 seconds - as long as the user stays idle, there will be no
	  break - when the user stays idle for the duration of the planned
	  break, the break is skipped. - when the user starts working
	  again, the break will be activated.... idea from Bram.

	* trunk/playground/utils/rsibreak/src/rsiwidget.cpp,
	  trunk/playground/utils/rsibreak/src/rsiwidget.h: Worked on the
	  idle detection. I used this scheme: - When it is time to break,
	  wait for 5 seconds inactivity to not completely interrupt the
	  workflow (<- this part is new) - When it is time to break and the
	  user is already idle for the duration of that break: delay the
	  break - when it is time to break and the user is already idle
	  since the last break: delay this break and the next one.

	  (added), trunk/playground/utils/rsibreak/src/Makefile.am,
	  trunk/playground/utils/rsibreak/TODO: Fix the application icon.
	  Deleted non-binary icons and added the xclock icon as long as
	  there is no alternative...

	* trunk/playground/utils/rsibreak/src/main.cpp,

	  trunk/playground/utils/rsibreak/TODO: There is no need for
	  multiple RSIBreaks...

2005-10-12 18:51 +0000 [r469972]  Tom Albers tomalbers@kde.nl

	* trunk/playground/utils/rsibreak/ChangeLog (added),
	  trunk/playground/utils/rsibreak/configure.in.bot (added),
	  trunk/playground/utils/rsibreak/src/main.cpp,
	  trunk/playground/utils/rsibreak/ChangeLog.Summary (added),
	  trunk/playground/utils/rsibreak/src/rsibreak.lsm,
	  trunk/playground/utils/rsibreak/release_rsibreak.rb,
	  trunk/playground/utils/rsibreak/makechangelog (added): Added a
	  configure.in.bot to tell the user if idle detection will be
	  possible. Added a Changelog with some secret script found in
	  kde-common, a summary file and bumped the version so I can make a
	  new tarball.

2005-10-12 16:35 +0000 [r469944]  Tom Albers tomalbers@kde.nl

	* trunk/playground/utils/rsibreak/src/rsiwidget.cpp,
	  trunk/playground/utils/rsibreak/src/rsiwidget.h: This prevents a
	  break immediatly after you return to your desk after been in a
	  meeting or lunch for example. When you have been away a while,
	  RSIBreak remembers that and will skip the next break...

2005-10-11 21:46 +0000 [r469662]  Tom Albers tomalbers@kde.nl

	* trunk/playground/utils/configure.in.in,
	  trunk/playground/utils/rsibreak/TODO: administrative, should be
	  able to generate Dox now, but it does not work. Ideas are
	  welcome, I give up.

2005-10-11 19:16 +0000 [r469634]  Tom Albers tomalbers@kde.nl

	* trunk/playground/utils/rsibreak/src/rsiwidget.cpp,
	  trunk/playground/utils/rsibreak/configure.in.in,
	  trunk/playground/utils/rsibreak/src/rsiwidget.h,
	  trunk/playground/utils/rsibreak/src/Makefile.am,
	  trunk/playground/utils/rsibreak/TODO: RSIBreak meets idle
	  detection! If you have not touched your mouse or keyboard after
	  the preivous break, there is no need to break again. If you
	  haven't done it for twice that time, you even gain a break (so
	  the big break gets postponed one break). This was one of the most
	  wanted features!

2005-10-09 00:53 +0000 [r468689]  Tom Albers tomalbers@kde.nl

	* trunk/playground/utils/rsibreak/src/rsiwidget.cpp: Add some

	  Initial import of rsibreak. Its goal is to interrupt yout work
	  behind the computer at a certain interval, so you have to take a
	  break. This util can help to prevent rsi, repititive strain
	  injury, when configured correctly and not pressing the 'minimize'
	  button continously. ;-) The interval times and duration are
	  configurable, just like the images you can see during the break.
	  Also you can disable/enable the counter and minimize button.
