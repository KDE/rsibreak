	* trunk/playground/utils/rsibreak/src/rsitimer.cpp: In commit
	  #523619 I made the idle detection guards too strong. Moved the
	  guards one level deeper. This fixes the issue that the timers
	  were not reset when a break has passed (with popup). A symptom
	  was that the docker icon was still filled after a relax moment.

	* trunk/playground/utils/rsibreak/src/rsistats.cpp,
	  trunk/playground/utils/rsibreak/src/rsistatwidget.cpp: Partially
	  revert the commit of Bram, 525047, which converts to the QTime
	  back to a QDateTime. Partially reverted, because we need to use a
	  QDateTime internally, but to present it to the user a QTime is
	  sufficient. So changed the display and the calculation of the
	  width of the display.

2006-03-30 21:46 +0000 [r524665]  Tom Albers tomalbers@kde.nl

	* trunk/playground/utils/rsibreak/src/rsitimer.cpp: The last bug I
	  found is squashed by this fix. Maybe Bram wants to fix this The
	  Right Way, but an extra safeguard in case of weird situation can
	  not do any harm. Summary: timers stop running when user does not
	  want idle-detection durng normal operation and they receive a
	  break...

	* trunk/playground/utils/rsibreak/src/rsistats.cpp,
	  trunk/playground/utils/rsibreak/src/rsitimer.cpp: Ok, tested the
	  whole evening. X tells us there has been a movement at 1199 (when
	  the monitor is turned off). As I can not distinguish this from
	  normal movement, i'll eat all activity in that timeslot. Chances
	  that people actually start using the computer after 20 minutes
	  idlesness in that slot are pretty slim anyways. I just hope that
	  the 20 minute is not configurable somewhere.

	  probably get RSI if I have to wait for 4294967295 tiny breaks

	  the tooltip for the amount of big breaks left? It causes the
	  symptom described above. Try it yourself: enter the configuration
	  dialog, cancel it and watch the tooltip. Reason: RSITimer sets
	  m_currentInterval to 0, and RSIWidget subtracts this with 1.
	  Result: -1. And i18n() with plurals can't handle -1. Simple.
	  Summarized: Is that -1 really neccessary?

	  seperate slots to suspend. - Also, gives the possibility to set
	  the targettime to the current time, so the tooltip will show that
	  rsibreak is suspended instead of counting to 0 and then show that
	  message. - Also, prevent that the avarage calculation continious
	  in suspended state, because that will change the tray icon ;-)

	* trunk/playground/utils/rsibreak/src/rsiwidget.cpp: Since some of

	  the code, without functionality loss, but maybe with some
	  regressions ;-) Also fixed a whatsthis error, showing random

	  now. I'm not sure that (int)ceil() is the best way to do it
	  though (i want the difference in time, rounded up).

2005-10-21 10:30 +0000 [r472589]  Tom Albers tomalbers@kde.nl

	* trunk/playground/utils/rsibreak/src/rsiwidget.cpp: Cleaned up a
	  bit too much yesterday. After a bigBreak counter was not
	  resetted, so the next break is again a BigBreak.

2005-10-20 18:35 +0000 [r472432]  Tom Albers tomalbers@kde.nl

	* trunk/playground/utils/rsibreak/src/rsiwidget.cpp,
	  trunk/playground/utils/rsibreak/src/rsiwidget.h: Again changes in
	  the logic to have a break: - when it is time to have a break, and
	  the user is busy, wait for 5 seconds inactivity within a maximum
	  of 30 seconds - as long as the user stays idle, there will be no
	  break - when the user stays idle for the duration of the planned
	  break, the break is skipped. - when the user starts working
	  again, the break will be activated.... idea from Bram.

	* trunk/playground/utils/rsibreak/src/rsiwidget.cpp,
	  trunk/playground/utils/rsibreak/src/rsiwidget.h: Remove warning
	  for a fresh install and fixed a problem with the loading of
	  images, right after you change the path in the settings: the
	  image was only loaded _after_ the first brake.

2005-10-19 19:19 +0000 [r472072]  Tom Albers tomalbers@kde.nl

	* trunk/playground/utils/rsibreak/src/rsiwidget.cpp: Not
	  initialised variable, resulting in sometimes a break at start.
	  Reported by Bram.

2005-10-19 17:26 +0000 [r472053]  Tom Albers tomalbers@kde.nl

	* trunk/playground/utils/rsibreak/src/rsiwidget.cpp: Fixed the
	  logic a bit more and made the code more readible. Should be ok
	  now.

2005-10-18 20:02 +0000 [r471799]  Tom Albers tomalbers@kde.nl

	* trunk/playground/utils/rsibreak/src/rsiwidget.cpp,
	  trunk/playground/utils/rsibreak/src/rsiwidget.h: Worked on the
	  idle detection. I used this scheme: - When it is time to break,
	  wait for 5 seconds inactivity to not completely interrupt the
	  workflow (<- this part is new) - When it is time to break and the
	  user is already idle for the duration of that break: delay the
	  break - when it is time to break and the user is already idle
	  since the last break: delay this break and the next one.
	  (keep-it-out-of-my-face-right-after-lunch-feature) testing needed

	  kde-common, a summary file and bumped the version so I can make a
	  new tarball.

	* trunk/playground/utils/rsibreak/src/rsiwidget.cpp,
	  trunk/playground/utils/rsibreak/src/rsiwidget.h: This prevents a
	  break immediatly after you return to your desk after been in a

	  RSIBreak remembers that and will skip the next break...

2005-10-11 21:46 +0000 [r469662]  Tom Albers tomalbers@kde.nl

	* trunk/playground/utils/configure.in.in,

	  welcome, I give up.

	  trunk/playground/utils/rsibreak/src/Makefile.am,
	  trunk/playground/utils/rsibreak/TODO: RSIBreak meets idle
	  detection! If you have not touched your mouse or keyboard after
	  the preivous break, there is no need to break again. If you
	  haven't done it for twice that time, you even gain a break (so
	  the big break gets postponed one break). This was one of the most
	  wanted features!

2005-10-09 00:53 +0000 [r468689]  Tom Albers tomalbers@kde.nl

	  Initial import of rsibreak. Its goal is to interrupt yout work
	  behind the computer at a certain interval, so you have to take a
	  break. This util can help to prevent rsi, repititive strain
	  injury, when configured correctly and not pressing the 'minimize'
	  button continously. ;-) The interval times and duration are
	  configurable, just like the images you can see during the break.
	  Also you can disable/enable the counter and minimize button.
