	  idle for the time of a tiny break, the break was aborted ;-) -
	  when the short break is scheduled at the same time as the big
	  break, the delete the tiny break info in the tooltip - remove the
	  lines of the tooltip, when the time_left is 0 for that line (else
	  during a break it would state that there is one second left to
	  that break) - fixed bug: DEBUG=true did not devide the
	  max_interval by 60, hence giving a strange 1800 seconds when
	  expecting 20 seconds. Remaining bugs: - do not show the tooltip
	  when the relaxpopup is active, dont know if that is possible...

	* trunk/playground/utils/rsibreak/src/rsiwidget.cpp,
	  trunk/playground/utils/rsibreak/src/rsitimer.cpp: o Better fix
	  for the -1 issue. Don't set to 0 but to
	  m_intervals["big_interval"] instead. o Reverting some LOC
	  regarding passing const int with the setCounters signal. const is
	  not really crucial, so I removed it locally, but I accidently
	  committed a part of this.

2005-12-13 23:17 +0000 [r488309]  Bram Schoenmakers bramschoenmakers@kde.nl

	* trunk/playground/utils/rsibreak/src/rsiwidget.cpp: I will
	  probably get RSI if I have to wait for 4294967295 tiny breaks
	  before the big break comes in. Why is the -1 there when setting
	  the tooltip for the amount of big breaks left? It causes the
	  symptom described above. Try it yourself: enter the configuration
	  dialog, cancel it and watch the tooltip. Reason: RSITimer sets
	  m_currentInterval to 0, and RSIWidget subtracts this with 1.
	  Result: -1. And i18n() with plurals can't handle -1. Simple.
	  Summarized: Is that -1 really neccessary?

	  trunk/playground/utils/rsibreak/src/rsitimer.cpp: - Change

	  keep the state while you are in the config. That means two
	  seperate slots to suspend. - Also, gives the possibility to set
	  the targettime to the current time, so the tooltip will show that
	  rsibreak is suspended instead of counting to 0 and then show that
	  message. - Also, prevent that the avarage calculation continious
	  in suspended state, because that will change the tray icon ;-)

2005-12-10 22:19 +0000 [r487524]  Tom Albers tomalbers@kde.nl

	* trunk/playground/utils/rsibreak/src/rsitimer.cpp: Bug fix: after

2005-10-21 14:50 +0000 [r472663]  Tom Albers tomalbers@kde.nl

	* trunk/playground/utils/rsibreak/src/rsiwidget.cpp: Since some of
	  the intelligence is also handled elsewhere, I can remove some of
	  the code, without functionality loss, but maybe with some
	  regressions ;-) Also fixed a whatsthis error, showing random
	  numbers and fixed the counter, which should count down correctly
	  now. I'm not sure that (int)ceil() is the best way to do it
	  though (i want the difference in time, rounded up).

2005-10-21 10:30 +0000 [r472589]  Tom Albers tomalbers@kde.nl

	* trunk/playground/utils/rsibreak/src/rsiwidget.cpp: Cleaned up a

2005-10-20 18:35 +0000 [r472432]  Tom Albers tomalbers@kde.nl

	* trunk/playground/utils/rsibreak/src/rsiwidget.cpp,
	  trunk/playground/utils/rsibreak/src/rsiwidget.h: Again changes in
	  the logic to have a break: - when it is time to have a break, and
	  the user is busy, wait for 5 seconds inactivity within a maximum
	  of 30 seconds - as long as the user stays idle, there will be no
	  break - when the user stays idle for the duration of the planned
	  break, the break is skipped. - when the user starts working
	  again, the break will be activated.... idea from Bram.

	* trunk/playground/utils/rsibreak/src/rsiwidget.cpp,

2005-10-18 20:02 +0000 [r471799]  Tom Albers tomalbers@kde.nl

	* trunk/playground/utils/rsibreak/src/rsiwidget.cpp,
	  trunk/playground/utils/rsibreak/src/rsiwidget.h: Worked on the
	  idle detection. I used this scheme: - When it is time to break,
	  wait for 5 seconds inactivity to not completely interrupt the
	  workflow (<- this part is new) - When it is time to break and the
	  user is already idle for the duration of that break: delay the
	  break - when it is time to break and the user is already idle
	  since the last break: delay this break and the next one.

	  Initial import of rsibreak. Its goal is to interrupt yout work
	  behind the computer at a certain interval, so you have to take a
	  break. This util can help to prevent rsi, repititive strain
	  injury, when configured correctly and not pressing the 'minimize'
	  button continously. ;-) The interval times and duration are
	  configurable, just like the images you can see during the break.
	  Also you can disable/enable the counter and minimize button.
