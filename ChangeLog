	* trunk/playground/utils/rsibreak/src/rsiwidget.cpp,
	  trunk/playground/utils/rsibreak/src/rsiwidget.h: Add a passive
	  popup to indicate rsibreak is waiting for a break. Unexpectedly
	  this works quite nicely.

	  readnumentry, You can put a DEBUG=true in the settings so the
	  minutes filled in the settings become seconds.

	* trunk/playground/utils/rsibreak/src/setupgeneral.cpp: Make it

2005-10-21 14:50 +0000 [r472663]  Tom Albers tomalbers@kde.nl

	* trunk/playground/utils/rsibreak/src/rsiwidget.cpp: Since some of
	  the intelligence is also handled elsewhere, I can remove some of
	  the code, without functionality loss, but maybe with some
	  regressions ;-) Also fixed a whatsthis error, showing random
	  numbers and fixed the counter, which should count down correctly
	  now. I'm not sure that (int)ceil() is the best way to do it
	  though (i want the difference in time, rounded up).

2005-10-21 10:30 +0000 [r472589]  Tom Albers tomalbers@kde.nl

	* trunk/playground/utils/rsibreak/src/rsiwidget.cpp: Cleaned up a
	  bit too much yesterday. After a bigBreak counter was not
	  resetted, so the next break is again a BigBreak.

2005-10-20 18:35 +0000 [r472432]  Tom Albers tomalbers@kde.nl

	* trunk/playground/utils/rsibreak/src/rsiwidget.cpp,
	  trunk/playground/utils/rsibreak/src/rsiwidget.h: Again changes in
	  the logic to have a break: - when it is time to have a break, and
	  the user is busy, wait for 5 seconds inactivity within a maximum
	  of 30 seconds - as long as the user stays idle, there will be no
	  break - when the user stays idle for the duration of the planned
	  break, the break is skipped. - when the user starts working
	  again, the break will be activated.... idea from Bram.

	* trunk/playground/utils/rsibreak/src/rsiwidget.cpp,
	  trunk/playground/utils/rsibreak/src/rsiwidget.h: Remove warning
	  for a fresh install and fixed a problem with the loading of
	  images, right after you change the path in the settings: the
	  image was only loaded _after_ the first brake.

2005-10-19 19:19 +0000 [r472072]  Tom Albers tomalbers@kde.nl

	* trunk/playground/utils/rsibreak/src/rsiwidget.cpp: Not
	  initialised variable, resulting in sometimes a break at start.
	  Reported by Bram.

2005-10-19 17:26 +0000 [r472053]  Tom Albers tomalbers@kde.nl

	* trunk/playground/utils/rsibreak/src/rsiwidget.cpp: Fixed the
	  logic a bit more and made the code more readible. Should be ok
	  now.

2005-10-18 20:02 +0000 [r471799]  Tom Albers tomalbers@kde.nl

	* trunk/playground/utils/rsibreak/src/rsiwidget.cpp,
	  trunk/playground/utils/rsibreak/src/rsiwidget.h: Worked on the
	  idle detection. I used this scheme: - When it is time to break,
	  wait for 5 seconds inactivity to not completely interrupt the
	  workflow (<- this part is new) - When it is time to break and the
	  user is already idle for the duration of that break: delay the
	  break - when it is time to break and the user is already idle
	  since the last break: delay this break and the next one.
	  (keep-it-out-of-my-face-right-after-lunch-feature) testing needed

	  new tarball.

	* trunk/playground/utils/rsibreak/src/rsiwidget.cpp,
	  trunk/playground/utils/rsibreak/src/rsiwidget.h: This prevents a

	  RSIBreak remembers that and will skip the next break...

	* trunk/playground/utils/configure.in.in,

	  trunk/playground/utils/rsibreak/TODO: RSIBreak meets idle
	  detection! If you have not touched your mouse or keyboard after
	  the preivous break, there is no need to break again. If you
	  haven't done it for twice that time, you even gain a break (so
	  the big break gets postponed one break). This was one of the most
	  wanted features!

2005-10-09 00:53 +0000 [r468689]  Tom Albers tomalbers@kde.nl

	  Initial import of rsibreak. Its goal is to interrupt yout work
	  behind the computer at a certain interval, so you have to take a
	  break. This util can help to prevent rsi, repititive strain
	  injury, when configured correctly and not pressing the 'minimize'
	  button continously. ;-) The interval times and duration are
	  configurable, just like the images you can see during the break.
	  Also you can disable/enable the counter and minimize button.
