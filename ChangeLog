	* trunk/playground/utils/rsibreak/src/rsiwidget.cpp,
	  trunk/playground/utils/rsibreak/src/rsiwidget.h: This prevents a
	  break immediatly after you return to your desk after been in a
	  meeting or lunch for example. When you have been away a while,
	  RSIBreak remembers that and will skip the next break...

	* trunk/playground/utils/configure.in.in,
	  trunk/playground/utils/rsibreak/TODO: administrative, should be
	  able to generate Dox now, but it does not work. Ideas are
	  welcome, I give up.

	  trunk/playground/utils/rsibreak/src/rsiwidget.h,
	  trunk/playground/utils/rsibreak/src/Makefile.am,
	  trunk/playground/utils/rsibreak/TODO: RSIBreak meets idle
	  detection! If you have not touched your mouse or keyboard after
	  the preivous break, there is no need to break again. If you
	  haven't done it for twice that time, you even gain a break (so
	  the big break gets postponed one break). This was one of the most
	  wanted features!

	* trunk/playground/utils/rsibreak/src/rsiwidget.cpp: Add some

	  scripts)

	  Initial import of rsibreak. Its goal is to interrupt yout work
	  behind the computer at a certain interval, so you have to take a
	  break. This util can help to prevent rsi, repititive strain
	  injury, when configured correctly and not pressing the 'minimize'
	  button continously. ;-) The interval times and duration are
	  configurable, just like the images you can see during the break.
	  Also you can disable/enable the counter and minimize button.
